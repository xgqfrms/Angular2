# ngClassifieds - Source Code for Getting Started with Angular 1.x

This is the source code for my course **[Getting Started with Angular 1.x](https://school.scotch.io/getting-started-with-angularjs-1x)** available at [Scotch School](https://school.scotch.io).

To run the app, first install the dependencies with npm.

```bash
npm install
```

Then serve the app with whichever web server you like. You can use **http-server** for a quick solution.

```bash
npm install -g http-server
http-server
```
